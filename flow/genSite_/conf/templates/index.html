			<p class="pt-5">This project consists of Weekly Summary of Government Resoultions(GR) issued by Government of Maharashtra. The GRs are obtained from the site <a class="text-blue-500" href="https://gr.maharashtra.gov.in/">https://gr.maharashtra.gov.in/</a>.
			  
			<p class="pt-5">Every Sunday the Orgpedia repository is refereshed with the GRs issued in the previous week. Each GR is annotated with the district, category and the quantity of the funds mentioned in the GR, after that weekly summaries are generated based on the annotations. In future we plan to add more annotations as well increase the granularity of the annotation.

			  <p class="pt-5">We are publishing these two weekly summaries:
			  
			  <ol class="pl-5 list-decimal list-outside text-base">
			    <li class="py-2.5"><a class="text-blue-500" href="dept/summary.html">Department-wise Weekly Summary</a>
			    <li class="py-2.5"><a class="text-blue-500" href="dist/summary.html"> District-wise Weekly Summary</a>
			  </ol>

			  <p class="pt-5">You can also sign up for getting these summaries in email inbox by choosing the summaries you are interested at this <a class="text-blue-500" href="">site</a>. Earlier summaries can be found on the <a class="text-blue-500" href="">archive</a> page.

			  <p class="pt-5">Currently the summaries are published in English, Marathi.
